Homework 5
To start off with this project I was really excited. I really enjoyed learning about manipulating 2d arrays and how to make a game\
I thought that my code was pretty well done until I tried to get it to work and it did not work. I watched youtube videos, I looked
for help on other websites but I could not figure out where I was going wrong. I consulted my brother and he helped me a bit, but
it was not until I had a meeting with the professor did I actually get where I went wrong and was able to fix it. Thank you professor
